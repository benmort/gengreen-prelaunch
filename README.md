## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

#### Gatsby Image

This plugin handles producing images in multiple sizes.

When you install the gatsby image plugn via `npm install gatsby-plugin-image`, you can import your image similar to a module and pass it to the `src` prop.

```jsx
import PhoneAndKeyboardMobileImg from "../images/mobile/image-phone-and-keyboard.jpg"

const Image = () => <img src={PhoneAndKeyboardMobileImg} alt="" />
```

In order to appreciate this plugin, lets say the image above was 1024px wide. If you were to view this on your phone and without a wifi connection, loading this entire image is definitely not a good thing as it will eat into the client's data plan. This plugin will check the width of the viewport and load the appropriate size.

#### Image Filter

Not to be confused with the `filter` CSS property.

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components"

const Container = styled.div`
  background: #f16718;

  img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    opacity: 0.75;
  }
`
```

The above code will apply an orange overlay to its `img` child element.

### Continued development

This project has made me interested in image optimization and learning how to prevent underfetching or overfetching data. Apparently a querying language called [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) fixes this issue. I will learn this language and use it as my backend for this [frontend challenge by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/invoice-app-i7KaLTQjl).

### Useful resources
